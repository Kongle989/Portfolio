        <div className="myLabel">About Me</div>
        <p>Hello my name is Kong Le and I am a junior web developer residing in Winter Park, Florida. With the skills I
            currently possesed I am able to do simple front end UI/UX and backend webpages. I am ready to take it to the
            next level!</p>

        <div className="myLabel">Past</div>
        <p>I was born in Vietnam and moved to Florida when I was six years old. I have been here for most of my life.
            Sinced my earlier years I have always been gifted in math. As I grow older I begin to take a more logical
            approach to every aspect of my life. I tinkle with things I don't understand to get a better idea of how
            they
            work. In every part of my life I have always felt that I am either a(n) creator, inventor, or builder.</p>
        <div className="myLabel">Present</div>
        <p>After obtaining my A.S. degree in Computer Programming and having recently graduated from the UCF Coding
            Bootcamp, I am currently seeking a career in web development. I want to better my skills and be the best at
            what
            I do. I never want to stop learning and growing.</p>
        <div className="myLabel">Future</div>
        <p>Web development isn't my passion. It's programming in general. I want to eventually know as much as I can
            about it. I want to get into software development, cyber security, robotics, gaming, and A.I. It's probably
            impossible for one person to learn all that in depth but it's not going to stop me from trying. I want to
            truely be a part of the IT world.</p>
